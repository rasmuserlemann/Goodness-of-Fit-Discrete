# Power study code in the paper *Conditional Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Discrete Distributions*
The code is written in R.

## Anderson-Darling, Cramer-von Mises and Kolmogorov Smirnov test statistics
These are regular quadratic goodness-of-fit test statistics. Null hypothesis model maximum likelihood estimates are used. For the geometric distribution, this is calculated by n/(sum(d)+n).
